# Toddler_Words_Backend

This is the backend for my Toddler Words Application this will allow users to creat a profile and add personal touches to the words their children are learning.

Users will be able to add to a few different catagories to create a new page for their children to go through like Family, Places, Things, and Clothes. The user can add personal images and audio files associated with the word they create for their child to learn. This helps with having a familiar voice and pictures for their personal world to associate with the words they are working on learning.

Users will also be able to create edit and delete their personal profiles.

I would like to make it so users can possibly add their own pictures to the categories already avalible in the application via the API and coded images from the front end.

I will also move the hard coded data from the frontend into the database.
